# TagWin - a tag library and service for Grails

## Intro

The TagWin plugin is a little tag library with some utility methods
sometimes needed for display or filtering purposes:

It can strip HTML-tags from a string or just remove links 
and replace them with the link text. It also offers shortening
and wrapping methods to prevent long user supplied strings from 
blowing up your web-ui layout.
